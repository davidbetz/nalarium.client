# nalarium.client (**historical**)

Largely deprecated; ASP.NET's bundling and minification and MVC completely replaced it for me. This was for WebForms. This would gather up all your CSS and JS files from all sources everywhere and streamline them into a single place (either at the end of the page in a cust om OnDomLoad location or whatever). It would even suck resources out of DLLs for you. There were also providers to abstract the differences between jQuery and Prototype. Well, since jQuery (may it now [RIP](https://angularjs.org/)) won... that's moot.
